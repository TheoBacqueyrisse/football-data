This projects aims to optimize the expected goals of shots following an indirect free kick using **StatsBomb** free data. 

We use an **XGBoost** model to **predict the xG** of an action with best **MAE of 0,019**

Then we develop a **Genetic model** to optimize the **Players and Shot positions** to **improve the xG**, giving a mean **improvement of 144%**.
